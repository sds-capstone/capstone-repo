abstract: |
  In September 2021, a significant jump in seismic activity on the island of La Palma (Canary Islands, Spain) signaled the start of a volcanic crisis that still continues at the time of writing. Earthquake data is continually collected and published by the Instituto Geogr√°phico Nacional (IGN). ...

## Introduction

> Introduction and Motivation: What is the problem you are trying to solve? Why is this problem interesting? What has been tried before? What have been the shortcoming of those approaches that necessitate your efforts? Often, this section will conclude with a subsection (or paragraph) outlining ‚Äúour contributions.‚Äù What is the new knowledge that this paper contributes?

```{r}
eruptions <- c(1492, 1585, 1646, 1677, 1712, 1949, 1971, 2021)
n_eruptions <- length(eruptions)
```

```{r}
#| label: fig-timeline
#| fig-cap: Timeline of recent earthquakes on La Palma
#| fig-alt: An event plot of the years of the last 8 eruptions on La Palma.
#| fig-height: 1.5
#| fig-width: 6
par(mar = c(3, 1, 1, 1) + 0.1)
plot(eruptions, rep(0, n_eruptions), 
  pch = "|", axes = FALSE)
axis(1)
box()
```

```{r}
#| output: false
avg_years_between_eruptions <- mean(diff(eruptions[-n_eruptions]))
avg_years_between_eruptions
```

Based on data up to and including 1971, eruptions on La Palma happen every `r round(avg_years_between_eruptions, 1)` years on average.

La Palma is one of the west most islands in the Volcanic Archipelago of the Canary Islands (@fig-map). 



### Relevant work

Studies of the magma systems feeding the volcano, such as @marrero2019, have proposed that there are two main magma reservoirs feeding the Cumbre Vieja volcano; one in the mantle (30-40km depth) which charges and in turn feeds a shallower crustal reservoir (10-20km depth).

Eight eruptions have been recorded since the late 1400s (@fig-timeline).

### Our contribution

Data and methods are discussed @sec-data and @sec-methods, respectively.

## Data {#sec-data}

> Data: Where did it come from? What are some basic summary statistics, variable definitions, and/or visualizations that help the reader understand the data you are working with?

Read a clean version of data:

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
la_palma <- read_csv(here::here("quarto-manuscript/data/la-palma.csv"))
```

Create spatial plot:

```{r}
#| label: fig-spatial-plot
#| fig-cap: "Locations of earthquakes on La Palma since 2017"
#| fig-alt: "A scatterplot of earthquake locations plotting latitude
#|   against longitude."
la_palma |> 
  ggplot(aes(Longitude, Latitude)) +
  geom_point(aes(color = Magnitude, size = 40-`Depth(km)`)) +
  scale_color_viridis_c(direction = -1) + 
  scale_size(range = c(0.5, 2), guide = "none") +
  theme_bw()
```


@fig-spatial-plot shows the location of recent Earthquakes on La Palma.


## Methods {#sec-methods}

> Methods: What did you actually do? What techniques or methods did you employ? What were the specifications for any statistical models you used? What software or packages did you use or develop?

Let $x$ denote the number of eruptions in a year. Then, $x$ can be modeled by a Poisson distribution

$$
p(x) = \frac{e^{-\lambda} \lambda^{x}}{x !}
$$ {#eq-poisson}

where $\lambda$ is the rate of eruptions per year. Using @eq-poisson, the probability of an eruption in the next $t$ years can be calculated.

| Name                 | Year   |
| -------------------- | ------ |
| Current              | 2021   |
| Tenegu√≠a             | 1971   |
| Nambroque            | 1949   |
| El Charco            | 1712   |
| Volc√°n San Antonio   | 1677   |
| Volc√°n San Martin    | 1646   |
| Tajuya near El Paso  | 1585   |
| Monta√±a Quemada      | 1492   |

: Recent historic eruptions on La Palma {#tbl-history}

@tbl-history summarises the eruptions recorded since the colonization of the islands by Europeans in the late 1400s.

## Results

> Results: What did you learn about the problem you identified in Section 1? This is where you put the tables, figures, and analytics by-products of your work.

## Conclusion

> Conclusion: What are the limitations of your work? What are some next steps that someone (either you or another research group) should consider in attempting to further your work? Remind us one last time about what you did.


### Limitations

### Future work

### Final thoughts

## Ethical statement {.appendix}

> Drawing on what you have learned about data science ethics in this class, discuss any ethical considerations in your project. For some projects, this statement could be quite short (one paragraph may suffice). For other projects, more detail may be needed (no more than 2 pages).
>
> Be expansive and creative in your thinking about **possible** ethical considerations. One way to do this assignment poorly would be to write a short statement asserting that there are no ethical considerations, only to have me think of several fairly obvious ones.

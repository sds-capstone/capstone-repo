## Final paper

Your final paper is a Quarto Manuscript in the `quarto-manuscript/` directory. 
Please see the documentation for [Quarto Manuscripts: RStudio](https://quarto.org/docs/manuscripts/authoring/rstudio.html).

You can build the paper locally from the root directory of the project by the following command in a **Terminal**:

```bash
quarto render quarto-manuscript
```

The [GitHub Action](https://quarto.org/docs/publishing/github-pages.html#github-action) in `.github/workflows/publish.yml` will trigger a build of the Quarto Manuscript on each commit. 
The badge above is linked to the status of that action.
